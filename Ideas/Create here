Nowadays students are in a mess for learning new stacks. There are many resources out there in the internet but a proper guidance/roadmap is missing. So, in our app we can inculcate this feature.

Along with books & roadmap our app can also contain the links to some of the best courses(free/paid) for that particular tech stack.

By this way the target audience will not only be limited to students, but also to all those people who wants to learn something under a proper guidance.
